# Solo Project React Quizzical Web Application

By Matthias Gruber

This project was the final project of the comprehensive React course by Scrimba offered through Coursera. The project utilizes the `React` library with `Vite` project bundling. The main programming language used is `JavaScript` supported by `CSS` and `HTML` code. To generate questions the Open Trivia Database API is utilized.

Only basic requirements and design were predefined by the course. The web application was to be developed entirely from scratch. Furthermore I added following features on my own initiative and idea.

1.  Introduced the option for the user to define the number of questions, select a category and chose the difficulty level. The questions will be drafted accordingly utilizing the respective API request.
2. Added the tracking of highscores utilizing a Firestore database.

## Requirements and instructions

The application was created utilizing the NPM package manager under following installation:
* `node` v20.11.0
